## SOFTSKY History

SOFTSKY was founded 1999 as custom software development company. Since 2015 SOFTSKY provides Penetration Testing services. Penetration Test (pentest) is a controlled simulation of a real-life cyber attack that reveals the actual state of organization's information security and its ability to withstand an intrusion with minimal losses.

SOFTSKY was established by the most experienced Ukrainian Software Developers, System Archiects and Information Security experts. In our work we use only reliable, proven methodologies and tools, some of which we have created ourselves. Because of our own know-how and experience we were able to significantly reduce the cost of our works and offer our customers high quality services for a perfectly balanced price.
