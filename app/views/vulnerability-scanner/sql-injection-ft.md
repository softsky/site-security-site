**In depth checking for SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Other Vulnerabilities**
=============================================================================================

SOFTSKY checks for all web vulnerabilities including SQL injection,
Cross site scripting and others. SQL injection is a hacking technique
which modifies SQL commands in order to gain access to data in the
database. Cross site scripting attacks allow a hacker to execute a
malicious script on your visitorâ€™s browser.

Detection of these vulnerabilities requires a sophisticated detection
engine. Paramount to web vulnerability scanning is not the number of
attacks that a scanner can detect, but the complexity and thoroughness
with the scanner launches SQL injection, Cross Site scripting and other
attacks. SOFTSKY has a state of the art vulnerability detection engine
which quickly finds vulnerabilities with a low number of false
positives. It also locates CRLF injection, Code execution, Directory
Traversal, File inclusion, checks for[vulnerabilities in File Upload
forms](http://www.softsky.com.ua/websitesecurity/upload-forms-threat/) and
much more. Click
