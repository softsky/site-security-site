**Analyzes your site against the Google Hacking Database**
==========================================================

The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) is a database of queries used by
hackers to identify sensitive data on your website such as portal logon
pages, logs with network security information, and so on. SOFTSKY
launches the Google hacking database queries onto the crawled content of
your web site and identifies sensitive data or exploitable targets
before a “search engine hacker” does.
