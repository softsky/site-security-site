**Test password protected areas and web forms with Automatic HTML form filler**
===============================================================================

SOFTSKY Web Vulnerability Scanner is able to automatically fill in web
forms and authenticate against web logins. Most web vulnerability
scanners are unable to do this or require complex scripting to test
these pages. Not so with SOFTSKY: Using the macro recording tool you
can record a logon or form filling process and store the sequence. The
scanner can then replay this sequence during the scan process and fill
in web forms automatically or logon to password protected areas.
