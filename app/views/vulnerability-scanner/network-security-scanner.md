**Key Features of SOFTSKY Network Security Scanner**
=====================================================

Comprehensive security audits require detailed inspection of the
perimeter of your public-facing network assets. SOFTSKY has integrated
the popular OpenVAS scanner within SOFTSKY Online Vulnerability Scanner
to provide a comprehensive perimeter network security scan that
integrates seamlessly with your web application security testing, all
from an easy to use simple cloud-based service.

Identify over 35,000 Network-layer Vulnerabilities.

**Scan Perimeter Network Services**
-----------------------------------

Insecure perimeter networks are the cause of most data breaches. The
perimeter is therefore one of the most important areas of your network
to secure against vulnerabilities, misconfiguration and other security
threats that could compromise security or availability of network
services.

SOFTSKY Online Vulnerability Scanner extends your network’s visibility
to outside threats and provides you with a perspective of your network’s
perimeter just like an attacker would see it.

Every network scan will initially start with a port scan of the IP
address the scanning target in order to discover open ports and running
services. Open ports are then tested for over 35,000 known
vulnerabilities and mis-configurations.

**Testing for Network Vulnerabilities**
---------------------------------------

Network vulnerability tests performed during a scan include assessing
security testing of detected devices such as routers, firewalls,
switches and load balancers; testing for weak passwords on common
protocols such as FTP, IMAP, database servers, POP3, Socks, SSH and
Telnet; Testing for DNS-related server vulnerabilities such as DNS zone
transfer attacks, open recursive DNS attacks and DNS cache poisoning
attacks; testing for badly configured Proxy Servers, weak SNMP community
strings, weak TLS/SSL ciphers and many other security weaknesses.

The scan’s findings are then presented inside the SOFTSKY Online
Vulnerability Scanner dashboard, from where a network security report
can be easily generated.

**Detecting Network Security Mis-configurations**
-------------------------------------------------

SOFTSKY Online Vulnerability Scanner can detect a wide array of network
security mis-configurations that could lead to sensitive data
disclosure, denial of service or even compromise of hosts. Tests include
testing for anonymous FTP access and writable directories over FTP,
badly configured Proxy Servers, weak SNMP community strings, weak
TLS/SSL ciphers and many other security weaknesses.
