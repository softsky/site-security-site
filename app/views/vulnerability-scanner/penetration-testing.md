===============================================

In addition to its automated scanning engine, Acunetix includes advanced
tools to allow penetration testers to fine tune web application security
checks:

    > reveal all data sent by a web application

    > taken days to perform manually can now be done in minutes.

-   Blind SQL Injector – Ideal for penetration testers, the Blind SQL
    > injector is an automated database data extraction tool that is
    > perfect for making manual tests that allow further testing for
    > SQL injections.
