# OpenSource Database

Unlike most of our competitors SOFTSKY **does not** maintain our own database of vulenrablities. That's just impossible to keep tracking many tens of thousands vulnerabilities that are constantly discovered. We use OpenSource databases from many community organizations like [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org), [OSCP](http://offensive-security.com), [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) and other. We also use tooling that nearly every hacker use - [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org) tools.
