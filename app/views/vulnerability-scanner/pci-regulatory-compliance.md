**Regulatory Compliance Reports for PCI, HIPAA and others**
===========================================================

In order to keep track of the vulnerabilities detected in your web
applications, SOFTSKY Vulnerability Scanner includes extensive reports
to help manage escalation and remediation of vulnerabilities while
assisting in task prioritization. SOFTSKY includes a set of Internal
Management reports to be able to share security findings internally with
developers and management, as well as a range of Compliance and
Classification reports for regulatory standards and best practice
guidelines.

Easily Generate a Wide Variety of Detailed Technical, Management and
Compliance Reports.

**PCI Compliance Reports**
--------------------------

PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card
processing-including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and
service providers, as well as all other entities that store, process or
transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data
(SAD).

**OWASP Top 10 (2013)**
-----------------------

The primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers,
architects, managers, and organizations about the consequences of the
most important web application security weaknesses. The Top 10 provides
basic techniques to protect against these high risk problem areas – and
also provides guidance on where to go from here.

**International Standard – ISO 27001**
--------------------------------------

ISO/IEC 27001 is an information security management system (ISMS)
standard with the objective of providing a model for establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and
improving an Information Security Management System.

**Other compliance reports**
----------------------------

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); WASC
Threat Classification; Sarbanes-Oxley; NIST Special Publication 800-53
(for FISMA); DISA-STIG Application Security; 2011 CWE/SANS Top 25 Most

**Developer Report**
--------------------

The Developer report provides a comprehensive summary of a scan. It will
display scan details, server details, alert summary and alert details,
pages with a long response time, a list of external links, email
addresses, client scripts and external hosts, together with remediation
examples and best practice recommendations for fixing the
vulnerabilities detected during a scan.

**Remediation**
---------------

Compare scans and find differences with previous scans; Easily re-audit
vulnerability fixes with ‘Re-test’ functionality; Export XML data for
integration with third-party tools.
