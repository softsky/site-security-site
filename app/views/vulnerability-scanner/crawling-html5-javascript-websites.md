*Scan HTML5 websites with SOFTSKY Web Vulnerability Scanner V9*

SOFTSKY DeepScan is the latest revolutionary technology available
within [SOFTSKY Web Vulnerability
V9](http://www.softsky.com.ua/vulnerability-scanner/) that can crawl and
scan modern HTML5 and JavaScript-based web applications; the only web
vulnerability scanner on the market capable of doing this.

**Other Scanners Lag Behind Modern Web Applications Development Technologies**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern HTML5-based web applications are using a large array of complex
JavaScript libraries like AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js, and
SproutCore.

Traditional web vulnerability scanners cannot cope with such
JavaScript-heavy applications and provide only superficial crawling
capabilities at best. Not being able to crawl properly means that HTML5
and JavaScript vulnerabilities go completely undetected.

Through the integration of DeepScan Technology in SOFTSKY Web
Vulnerability Scanner V9, our security researchers have developed a
unique way for the scanner to crawl through the plenitude of new tags,
attributes and events possible within modern dynamic websites.

**SOFTSKY DeepScan also supports scanning of Single Page Applications (SPA)**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application or web site that
fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user
experience akin to a desktop application. In an SPA, the appropriate
resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary,
usually in response to user actions.

**How does SOFTSKY DeepScan Perform when Put to the Test**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Our security researchers have created a vulnerable web application as a
test case for SOFTSKY WVS V9. This web application was built as a
Single Page Application (SPA) using modern web technologies such as
AngularJs, Bootstrap, CouchDB, Flask and Nginx. It can be found at
[http://testhtml5.vulnweb.com](http://testhtml5.vulnweb.com/).

When this test website is crawled using a traditional scanner, or with
DeepScan disabled, results are very limited

However, when scanning the same web application with DeepScan a very
different scenario emerges. Immediately noticeable is the fact that the
crawler can intercept all the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) calls performed from
JavaScript and added to the site structure for subsequent testing. Also,
the crawler can see all the other requests (images, scripts, HTML
templates â€¦) made by the scanned test application. For example,
AngularJs is dynamically loading HTML templates on the fly using AJAX
requests.

After the completion of the crawling, the final results look completely
different. The tested application has made various AJAX requests to the
web server requesting JSON data, HTML templates and so on. None of these
were visible in the initial crawl without SOFTSKY DeepScan Technology.

With the deep scan results available, the scanner can perform a
comprehensive audit of all these inputs looking for vulnerabilities.
Without a powerful JavaScript engine the crawler will receive only
partial results and will not find all potential HTML5 and JavaScript
vulnerabilities.

In addition, SOFTSKY DeepScan Technology drastically [improves the
detection of DOM-based XSS
vulnerabilities](http://www.softsky.com.ua/websitesecurity/improving-dom-xss-vulnerabilities-detection/).

[**SOFTSKY Web Vulnerability
Scanner**](http://www.softsky.com.ua/vulnerability-scanner/) **with
DeepScan technology is currently the only web vulnerability scanner
capable of scanning JavaScript Single Page Applications.**
