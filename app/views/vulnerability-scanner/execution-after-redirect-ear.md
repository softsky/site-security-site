# Execution After Redirect (EAR)

## Overview

Execution After Redirect (EAR) is an attack where an attacker ignores redirects and retrieves sensitive content intended for authenticated users. A successful EAR exploit can lead to complete compromise of the application.

## How to Test for EAR Vulnerabilities

Using most proxies it is possible to ignore redirects and display what is returned. In this test we use Burp Proxy.

1. Intercept request <https://vulnerablehost.com/managment_console>
2. Send to repeater.
3. View response.

## How to Prevent EAR Vulnerabilities

Proper termination should be performed after redirects. In a function a return should be performed. In other instances functions such as die() should be performed. This will tell the application to terminate regardless of if the page is redirected or not.
